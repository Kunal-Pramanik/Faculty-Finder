# Faculty Finder – Data Engineering Pipeline

## Overview
Faculty Finder is an end-to-end **Data Engineering project** that builds a clean, structured, and API-accessible dataset of university faculty information.  
The system enables downstream **semantic search and NLP use cases** by exposing cleaned faculty bios and research interests through a FastAPI service.

This project focuses on **data ingestion, transformation, storage, and serving**, following real-world data engineering practices.

---

## Problem Statement
Faculty information is often scattered across multiple web pages and stored in unstructured formats.  
The objective of this project is to:
- Crawl faculty profile data from a university website
- Clean and normalize unstructured HTML content
- Store the processed data in a relational database
- Serve the data via an API for analytics and semantic search

## Database Design

**Database:** `Faculty_finder`  
**Schema:** `faculty_list`  
**Table:** `faculty`

| Column | Type | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| faculty_id | TEXT (Primary Key) | Unique faculty identifier |
| name | TEXT | Faculty name |
| education | TEXT | Education details |
| research_interests | TEXT | Research interests |
| profile_url | TEXT | Faculty profile URL |
| clean_text | TEXT | Cleaned text for NLP tasks |

## API Endpoints

### Get All Faculty
GET /faculty

Returns all faculty records as structured JSON data.

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Install Dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy psycopg2 pandas

### 2. Start PostgreSQL
Ensure PostgreSQL is running and the database/table are created.

### 3. Run the API
uvicorn main:app --reload

### 4. Access the API
- API Endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8000/faculty  
- Swagger UI: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
